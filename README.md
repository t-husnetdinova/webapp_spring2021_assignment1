Names: Tammy Husnetdinova and Alex Verkest <br>
Class: CSCI4800-E01 <br>
Date: 1/17/21 <br>
Assignment: 1 for Online Social Network <br>
Scenario: In the first step of building your final project web app, youâ€™ve been asked to build static UIs for the web app and seek approval from an imaginary employer. The employer has a rough idea of the system they want, which they have already communicated with you, and you want first to build a blueprint of this web app to show it to them. The employer does not necessarily have a specific design in mind and has left that job to your team. You want to impress your employer with your design. <br>
Learning objectives: Our goal is to use our HTML5 and CSS3 skills to build a nice-looking UI that gives our employer an idea of the final website. Another goal in this class is not to learn one specific technology or a few commands or tags, but to use our knowledge to learn other concepts and put them into use as well. <br>
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript for code, Visual Studio Code for development and testing, Google Chrome browser for testing, Windows 10 OS <br>
Justification in design choices: COMING SOON <br>
Extra features: COMING SOON <br>
