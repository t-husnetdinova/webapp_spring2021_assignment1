# webapp_spring2021_assignment1

Names: Tammy Husnetdinova and Alex Verkest <br>
Class: CSCI4800-E01 <br>
Date: 1/17/21 <br>
Assignment: 1 for Online Social Network <br>
Scenario: In the first step of building your final project web app, you’ve been asked to build static UIs for the web app and seek approval from an imaginary employer. The employer has a rough idea of the system they want, which they have already communicated with you, and you want first to build a blueprint of this web app to show it to them. The employer does not necessarily have a specific design in mind and has left that job to your team. You want to impress your employer with your design. <br>
Learning objectives: Our goal is to use our HTML5 and CSS3 skills to build a nice-looking UI that gives our employer an idea of the final website. Another goal in this class is not to learn one specific technology or a few commands or tags, but to use our knowledge to learn other concepts and put them into use as well. <br>
TODO:
Build a sign-up page for users, as discussed next. <br>
<br>
Build a sign-in page for users, as discussed next. <br>
<br>
Build a home page for users (their main social network page). <br>
The homepage must look professional and include all different components of the social network that you have in mind, and include links to other pages you’ll add in the future.<br>
- Who to follow, trending hashtags, link to messages, link to profile<br>
<br>
<br>
The page must be populated with static dummy data for the sake of presentation<br>
For example, a few posts by different users, etc.<br>
You can choose to make your social network look similar to Facebook or Twitter Web apps (not Mobile apps) and build a similar homepage to those.<br>

Instead, you can think of a different type of social network and design that.<br>

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript for code, Visual Studio Code for development and testing, Google Chrome browser for testing, Windows 10 OS <br>

Justification in design choices: COMING SOON <br>
